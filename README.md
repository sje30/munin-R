# munin-R

Welcome to the home page of the Munin "introduction to R" workshop.

# Course materials before the workshop

In preparation for the workshop, we recommend that you learn some R.
To help with this, we have provided some [lecture
notes](https://github.com/lgatto/spr/blob/master/2020/spr-revised.pdf),
and accompanying videos.  You can check the course notes now, and if
you get accepted onto the workshop, we will give you access to the
videos.

We suggest that you will need to devote about 16 hours (4 hours/week)
to work through the slides and try some examples for yourself.  We
will have weekly [drop-in sessions](#drop-in-sessions) when you can 
join the course organisers on a Zoom session to ask us questions about
the material, or discuss potential case studies.

You won't need to learn R in its entirety (and you can ignore the
slides marked "Advanced") but with a bit of background, you will get
more out of the workshop.

# Workshop

At the workshop, we plan to work through some case studies of
applications of R, particularly geared to those of interest in the
scholarly communications community.  These case studies have not yet
been prepared (as of October 15th 2020), so we are looking for suggestions
from you --  what types of problems would you like us to discuss?  We
hope to do at least two case studies in detail.  To help seed the
conversation, here are some potential topics:

1. Text mining of journal articles.
2. Working with resources like orcid via R, e.g. https://ropensci.org/packages/literature/
3. Examining possibilities with https://ropensci.org/
4. Moving away from spreadsheets and into programming.
5. Reproducible research documents.
6. Parsing a 65Gb JSON file from crossref https://www.crossref.org/blog/free-public-data-file-of-112-million-crossref-records/

To give you an idea of what we think of might make good case studies,
here are [some examples](https://github.com/sje30/neuRo) that were
made from Neuroscience for a similar workshop.  The first Neuroscience
example took about an hour to go through.

To encourage discussion amongst the participants, we expect to limit
the workshop to about 20 people.  We will not be recording the session.

## Format of the workshop

On 17th November, We will meet over zoom 10-3pm (CET); we will have a
morning session (10-11:30) and afternoon session (1:30-3pm).  During
the lunch time break, we will keep the zoom session open to allow
participants to informally ask questions and discuss.

## Drop-in sessions

The following drop-in sessions are schedules for this course:

- October 26th, 13:00-14:00 CET / 12:00-13:00 GMT
- Nov 2th, 13:00-14:00 CET / 12:00-13:00 GMT
- Nov 9th, 13:00-14:00 CET / 12:00-13:00 GMT

You are welcome to join or leave at any time.
If there are any specific questiosn to discuss, we will use the following
online meetings as breakout rooms 

- Room one: https://meet.jit.si/munin-R-1
- Room two: https://meet.jit.si/munin-R-2

See the [privacy policy](https://jitsi.org/meet-jit-si-privacy/) and 
[Terms of Service](https://jitsi.org/meet-jit-si-terms-of-service/) for 
meet.jit.si.

If you have a concrete question with R, it would be helpful if you create
a [minimal reproducible 
example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
that is only a few lines of code.

## Participant chat

The drop-in sessions are the main event to ask the workshop leads your
questions. If you want to discuss amongst yourself, feel free to join the
following Gitter chat room:
